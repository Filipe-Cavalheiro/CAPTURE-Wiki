# Vehicle Setup

This section documents in detail the entire vehicle setup, including all the hardware components that make up the vehicle as well as the entire software package that allows it to function. In this way, the section is divided into two main subsections:

- [Hardware Setup](https://hardtekpt.github.io/M690B-Wiki/Hardware%20Setup/) - describes the main hardware components of the vehicle;
- [Software Setup](https://hardtekpt.github.io/M690B-Wiki/Software%20Setup/) - describes the software used, including the installation processes.
